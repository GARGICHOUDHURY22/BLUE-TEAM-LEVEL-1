Challenges Faced & How I Overcame Them

| Challenge                                  | Solution                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Exam Experience

The BTL1 exam   is fully **practical**, scenario-based, and reflects a Tier 1 SOC Analyst’s typical day. I was presented with:

- Simulated phishing emails
- Memory and disk images
- Logs requiring correlation
- Realistic investigation documentation requirements

The exam tested not just tool knowledge, but analytical thinking, time management, and end-to-end investigation capability. I built timelines, isolated attacker techniques using MITRE ATT\&CK, and submitted a detailed final report — mimicking a real-world SOC workflow.

Prerequisites & Recommended Background

While BTL1 is marketed as entry-level, I recommend the following before starting:

| Skill Area              | Level                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Networking Fundamentals | Basic (OSI, TCP/IP, ports, protocols)               |
| Windows OS Internals    | Moderate (registry, log locations, artifacts)       |
| Scripting               | Optional but helpful (PowerShell basics)            |
| Soft Skills             | Crucial (report writing, investigation structuring) |

Conclusion

Completing BTL1 was a significant step in my Blue Team journey. It gave me real-world, **SOC-ready skills** and the confidence to tackle Tier 1 and Tier 2 analyst roles with a strong foundation in:

End-to-end phishing investigation
Log analysis and SIEM correlation
Threat intelligence mapping
Full-stack digital forensics
Incident response handling and reporting

Conclusion

The Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) certification from Security Blue Team was a rigorous, hands-on journey that solidified my foundational skills as a blue teamer. Over the course of multiple interactive labs, quizzes, and real-world simulations, I developed critical expertise in incident response, phishing analysis, threat intelligence, digital forensics, and SIEM log analysis.

What made BTL1 especially valuable was its practical, tool-driven approach. From dissecting phishing emails in PhishTool to carving files with Scalpel, analyzing memory with Volatility, and triaging logs in Splunk, every section reinforced the mindset and methods expected from a Tier 1–2 SOC analyst. I learned to think like a defender, respond like an investigator, and document like a professional.

While some challenges—like correlating logs across time windows or parsing malformed phishing headers—were complex, they helped sharpen my ability to work under pressure with real-world tools. The capstone-style labs mirrored the fast-paced environment of an actual SOC.

This certification wasn’t just academic—it was operational. It gave me not only a wide toolkit but also the confidence to analyze, detect, and report threats with precision and structure. With BTL1 completed, I’m better equipped for real-world roles in cybersecurity and incident response.
